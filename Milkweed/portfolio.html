                    <h4>Issues and objections with Splicing Human DNA into a Dog</h4>

                    <p> Modification of a Canine DNA with Human DNA raises issues in some societies.</p>
                    <p> The question often raised is: "Are we creating a dog that is part human, or a human that is part dog?"</p>
                    <p>Our response is - "what is the difference?"</p>
                    <P>In some societies we treat dogs better than humans. And in other societies we treat humans worse than dogs"</P>
